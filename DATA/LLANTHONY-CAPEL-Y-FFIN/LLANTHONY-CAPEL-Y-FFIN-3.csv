NGR is in Capel-y-Ffin near the stated altitude. ,,,,,,,,,,
"NGR could be +/- 200m and the gauge is noted as moving between the monastery and church, which are 200m apart.",,,,,,,,,,
1913 total in brackets presumably because gauge moved mid June. The move was only 200m therefore total left in this record,,,,,,,,,,
